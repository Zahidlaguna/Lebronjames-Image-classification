# Lebronjames-Image-classification
This is a Project that takes images of Lebron James and other NBA players and tries to identify the images of Lebron James as Lebron James and the other images of thr NBA player and identify as NBA. The main premise of this project is to create a prediction model than can take photos of Lebron and try to accurately predict it. The dataset consists of 60 images of Lebron James and 60 images of other NBA players ranging from Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. This was a project primarily meant for my Machine Learning but I want to use to showcase my Skills in Machine Learning for Recruiters to see
