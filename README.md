# Lebronjames-Image-classification
This project takes images of Lebron James and other NBA players and tries to identify the photos of Lebron James as Lebron James and the other pictures of the NBA players and identify as NBA. The central premise of this project is to create a prediction model that can take photos of Lebron and try to predict it accurately. The dataset consists of 60 images of Lebron James and 60 of other NBA players ranging from Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. This project was primarily meant for my Machine Learning, but I want to use it to showcase my Skills in Machine Learning for Recruiters to see. 

My approach was to use random images of Lebron James and lucky NBA Players to try to predict Lebron James using Convolutional Neural Networks accurately.It should run as long as you have Tensorflow, sklearn, and cv2. 

To run it:
1) clone the repo into your local machine
2) Run all the cells
3) give it like 5 mins to train
4) and see the results
